# End of TiddlyDrive Support

Thank you for using TiddlyDrive. It was a fun project to make.

Unfortunately I am unable to continue working on the app. I am a self-supported developer and cannot keep up with the constant changes in Google's requirements and app maintenance. I wish I had the time, but even cave-dwelling programmers aren't autotrophs -- we gotta eat.

The app will still be available until Google has fully disabled it. As always, though, it is open source, so feel free to create a listing yourself.
